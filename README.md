# 3D-Experiments
Experiments using CSS3 3d.  A resizable cube in 3d space.  
I wanted to better understand CSS3 3d space, perspective, perspective origin etc.  What do divs in 3d look like in the browser?  What exactly does perspective:2000px actually mean? So inspired by the example on MDN https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/perspective I developed this small JavaScript app so that one can vary the different parameters then see the results.  Since some friends who teach code told me they would like to use it in their classes, I've put a copy here.  Please feel free to use it in any way that you want.  I've tested it in firefox 52, chrome 57, IE 11 and Microsoft Edge.  I haven't used any vendor prefixes in the CSS.  I found some issues in firefox not redrawing the page as expected. I'm still working to understand why this might be.  Any form of page reflow/refresh seems to bring up the drawing, but I can't find a way do do it automatically in code.  So any ideas/solution are welcome.
